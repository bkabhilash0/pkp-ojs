PKP Web Application Library
=======

The PKP Web Application Library (PKP-WAL) is a library shared by [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://github.com/pkp/ojs), [Open Conference Systems (OCS)](https://github.com/pkp/ocs), [Open Monograph Press (OMP)](http://github.com/pkp/omp), [Open Preprint Systems (OPS)](https://github.com/pkp/ops) and [Open Harvester Systems (OHS)](https://github.com/pkp/harvester). It is distributed with those applications in the `lib/pkp` subdirectory.

Issues (bugs) for all of those applications should be [created against this repository](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues).

## Issues
Issues (bugs) for any of the PKP applications should be created here. If you're not sure whether you're encountering a bug or not, consider posting in the [PKP Community Forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/).

Before creating a new issue, please [search the existing ones](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues) to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

If you confirm that you have found a new bug, or if you have identified a new feature request, [Create a new issue](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/new/choose) using one of the available templates.

Bugs are scheduled against the milestones that a fix will be released in. For example, if a bug was found in OJS 3.3.0, then it will be scheduled against a subsequent release like OJS 3.3.1 or OJS 3.4, which is the first release that will include the fix.

This repository is one of PKP's community spaces and all activities here are guided by [PKP's Code of Conduct](https://pkp.sfu.ca/code-of-conduct/). Please review the Code and help us create a welcoming environment for all participants.
