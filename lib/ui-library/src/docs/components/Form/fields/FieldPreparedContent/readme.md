## Usage

Use this component to provide the user with a rich text editor with prepared content that they can insert through a modal.

The `preparedContent` prop allows you to pass content to the editor and give the user a point-and-click tool to add that content. This is intended to be used in cases where data can be rendered inside of an email template.

When an editor is assigning a reviewer, the reviewer's name and the due date can be passed to the editor so that the editor can inject this information directly into the email.
