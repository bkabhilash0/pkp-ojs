## Props

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `...` | Supports all props in [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase). |
| `value` | The current value for this field. |
| `init` | Provide config properties for TinyMCE's `init` method. Any props you pass will be merged with defaults and can override them. See [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/). |
| `plugins` | Specify plugins the TinyMCE editor should load. See [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/#plugins). |
| `size` | One of `default` or `large`. Default: `default`. |
| `toolbar` | Provide the TinyMCE editor with a custom toolbar. See [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tinymce.com/docs/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar). |
| `uploadUrl` | Optionally provide a URL where images and other files can be uploaded. You still need to add the appropriate buttons and plugins to the `toolbar` and `plugins` props. The most common use is the [image](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/image/) plugin. |
| `wordLimit` | Optionally provide a word limit and the editor will display the word count as they type. |

## Events

See [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase).

## Usage

Use this component to provide the user with a rich text editor that supports bold, italics, links and other HTML code. This component uses the TinyMCE editor. You can pass `toolbar`, `plugins` and `init` props to customize the editor. See the [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/).

The `size` of the input area will signal to the user how much information they should enter into the field. The default `size` is best for one to two large paragraphs. If you expect a user to enter more than that, consider using the large size when it fits appropriately within the the form where it appears.

## Image Uploads

The editor will support image uploads, which are placed in the user's directory in the `public` files directory. You must provide the URL to the public files API and add the plugin and toolbar button.

```js
{
	...
	uploadUrl: 'http://journal.com/api/v1/_uploadPublicFile',
	toolbar: 'bold italic | link | image',
	plugins: 'paste,link,image'
}
```

The image upload will _not_ work in this documented example. It requires a valid upload URL. Use the following to get the `uploadUrl` from within a PKP application:

```php
$dispatcher = Application::get()
	->getRequest()
	->getDispatcher();

$uploadUrl = $dispatcher->url(
	Application::get()->getRequest(),
	ROUTE_API,
	$context->getPath(),
	'_uploadPublicFile'
);
```

Users must be logged in to upload files.
