## Props

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `...` | Supports all props in [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase). |
| `value` | The current value for this field. |
| `size` | One of `small`, `normal` or `large`. Default: `normal`. |

## Events

See [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase).

## Usage

Use this component for entering multiple lines of text when you want to restrict the user's entry to plain text. If the user is allowed to use bold, italics and other rich text markup, use the [FieldRichTextarea](#/component/Form/fields/FieldRichTextarea) component.

The `size` of the input area will signal to the user how much information they should enter into the field. Choose a size that is sufficient to display the expected input.
