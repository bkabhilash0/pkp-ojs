## Props

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `...` | Supports all props in [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase). |
| `value` | The current value for this field. |
| `options` | An array of objects defining the options which can be selected. |
| `publicationStatus` | One of the `PKPSubmission::STATUS_` constants. When set to `PKPSubmission::STATUS_QUEUED` or `PKPSubmission::STATUS_PUBLISHED` the issue selection will be hidden. |
| `publishedNoticeBase` | Text to be displayed when the publication is published in an issue. A string replace will be called to replace `{$issueId}` and `{$issueName}` params with the selected issue. |
| `scheduledNoticeBase` | Text to be displayed when the publication is scheduled for publication in an issue. A string replace will be called to replace `{$issueId}` and `{$issueName}` params with the selected issue. |
| `unscheduleLabel` | The label for the button to unschedule a scheduled publication. |

## Events

See [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase).

## Usage

A special component for selecting an issue. When a publication is scheduled or published, this field will no longer show the selection options and will instead show a message indicating the issue it was scheduled or published in.

In the example above, the "Assign to Issue" button will not work. This depends on the old JavaScript framework within the application.
