## Usage

Use the `Pagination` component when users can not view all items at once.

## Hide When Unused

Pagination should be hidden when only one page of results exists. This can be done in a parent component with the following code.

```html
<pagination
	v-if="lastPage > 1"
	...
/>
```

## Adjacent Pages

Leave `showAdjacentPages` set to the default unless you have a good reason to change it. It may be changed when the user is likely to want to "skip" the next or previous page, but not jump to the end.
